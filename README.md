## ðŸ’³ Project Title: **Bank Card UI Design**

---

## ðŸ“„ **Project Description**

The **Bank Card UI Design** project is a front-end development project focused on creating a digital, modern, and interactive visual representation of a bank card. It showcases how a physical bank card (like a credit or debit card) can be beautifully and realistically designed using **HTML** and **CSS**.

The main goal of this project is to replicate the look and feel of a real-world bank card â€” including elements such as the **card number**, **cardholder name**, **expiry date**, and **chip** â€” while incorporating modern UI/UX principles. In some versions, animations, shadows, gradients, and 3D effects are added for a more interactive and realistic experience.

This project is perfect for portfolios, financial dashboards, fintech app prototypes, or UI practice.
